        Our Mission
    </p>
    <h3>General Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The league will open opportunities for many students with a programming interest</li>
        <li>It will let these students showcase their unknown talent to us</li>
        <li>Allow students to achieve real-world experience</li>
        <li>Let students connect/network with their peers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>END GOAL:</h3>
    <p id="goal">We aim to create an organization that hosts competitions for many schools to compete in. (Create opportunities like TSA and Science Olympiad but specialize in coding) Our goal is to provide a competition at a local level, and is available to everybody.</p>

    <p class="heading">About us</p>
    <p class="text">Club Members will practice every meeting to engage in competitions. Through practice, they will get more skilled at time management in real competitions, so that they will have more success. Club members will practice either the speed/mini competitions, or they will work on the large project in the meetings. We aim to create a fostering passion for STEM and coding among our young minds.</p>
